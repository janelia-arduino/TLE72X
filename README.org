  SPIDER products are high integrated multichannel SPI driver for small
  current loads, such as relays & solenoids, LEDâ€™s, small bulbs and
  stepper motors. SPIDER devices are designed to be used in automotive
  and industrial applications with dedicated feature sets. Modularity
  within the families eliminates redesign costs as far as possible.

  The SPIDER family (TLE7230R, TLE7233EM, TLE7244SL) consists of 4 and 8 channel
  low-side and 8 channel low-side/ high-side drivers with 2 configurable
  channels. The products are scalable across the number of PWM inputs, current
  capability and additional functions.
